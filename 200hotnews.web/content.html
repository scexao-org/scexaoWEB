<h2> May 1, 2021: High accuracy stellar diameters with the GLINT nuller</h2>

<p>The GLINT nuller accurately measures stellar diameters 2.5x smaller that the Subaru Telescope diffraction limit, with sub-milliarcsecond precision. GLINT detects such small angles from nulling residuals: even though stars are smaller that the telescope diffraction limit, their small angular extent leaves a measurable residual in a nulling interferometer designed to cancel light from point sources. This milestone bodes well for GLINT's next goals: detection of planets and disks around nearby stars.</p>

<h2> Feb 8, 2021: MEC and FastPDI become open use modules</h2>

<p> We are opening two new modules for open use starting in S21B.</p>

<p> Following years of hard work, the <b>MKID exoplanet camera (MEC)</b> is now open to all Subaru users for scientific observations, starting in semester S21B. The SCExAO/Subaru and MKID/UCSB teams are excited to offer photon-counting imaging capability to astronomers, and looking forward to support this new mode. Check out the <a href="../030openuse.web/042mec.web/indexm.html">MEC page</a> for details. </p>

<p> <b>Fast polarization differential imaging (FastPDI)</b> combines a high frame rate nearIR camera (C-RED One) with polarization modulation to reveal faint polarized features. This new mode is especially powerful for probing circumstellar disks. Check out the <a href="../030openuse.web/043fastPDI.web/indexm.html">FastPDI page</a> for details.</p>
