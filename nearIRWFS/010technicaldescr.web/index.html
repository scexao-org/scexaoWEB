                    <h2>Position inside AO188</h2>

                    The deployment of the NIR WFS will hapen in three phases:
                    <li><b>Phase Ia:</b> In this phase, the NIR WFS is mounted inside AO188, and controls AO188's
                        188-element bimorph deformable mirror (DM). <b>This is the current phase offered for Open-Use
                            observations in S24A.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Phase Ib:</b> In this phase, the NIR WFS doesn't move, but we upgrade AO188's DM with an
                        ALPAO 64x64 DM, increasing the number of actuators in the pupil to about 3000. AO188 will then
                        become AO3k.</li>
                    <li><b>Phase II:</b> In this phase, A new Nasmyth Beam Switcher (NBS) will be installed behind
                        AO188/AO3k, allowing to send the light to any available instrument on the Nasmyth IR platform of
                        Subaru. At that point, a new LTAO mode will also be added between AO188 and the NBS, and the NIR
                        WFS will migrate outside the AO188 enclosure to a shared platform with the LTAO mode.</li>
                    <p></p>
                    In Phase I of the deployment of the NIR WFS, the optics fit inside AO188, while the C-RED
                    ONE camera is mounted on the side of the instrument. This was due to a lack of space inside AO188.
                    The camera has to be removable, since a collision is possible with SCExAO's own C-RED ONE camera
                    used for the FPDI mode. Therefore, in phase I, it will not be possible to have both cameras at the
                    same time. Figure 5 presents the current suggested position for the optics and the camera. The
                    dichroic beamsplitter sending some light to the NIR PyWFS is designed to be compatible with science
                    observation with IRCS, especially K-band spectroscopy. Finally, it will not impact other observing
                    modes with IRCS, SCExAO or IRD.

                    <h2>Optical path</h2>


                    The NIR WFS is designed to have two modes:

                    <h3>Pyramid Wavefront Sensing (PyWFS) mode</h3>

                    <p>This mode uses a pyramid-type optics to split the focal plane light into four, and reimage the
                        four
                        beams in the pupil plane. The PyWFS is used to control the wavefront with the deformable mirror
                        of
                        AO188.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <table style="width:100%">
                        <tr>
                            <th><a href="NIRWFS-opticalpath.png"> <img src="NIRWFS-opticalpath.png"
                                        alt="NIRWFS-opticalpath.png" width="500"> </a></th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>
                                <center><i>Optical path of the PyWFS mode.</i></center>

                        </tr>
                    </table>

                    <p>A dichroic beamsplitter pickoff is placed in the output beam of AO188, selecting some of the
                        light
                        that goes to the NIR WFS. The light is reflected by a first fold mirror, then collimated by a
                        collimation lens. The pupil of the telescope is then reimaged on a small mirror acting both as
                        the
                        modulator (using piezo actuators to move the PSF in a circular motion around the tip of the
                        pyrmaid
                        optics) and the steering mirror to control off-axis NGSs. The light is then reflected a couple
                        more
                        times, goes through a filter wheel that selects which band will be used, then goes through
                        compact
                        focusing optics, composed of a converging and a diverging lens. Another fold mirror sends the
                        focusing light on a pair of roof prisms, acting as a pyramid optic. This is the same concept
                        validated by the PyWFS of SCExAO. Once split into four beams, a pupil lens (and a last fold
                        mirror)
                        reimages the pupil on the detector of the C-RED ONE camera.</p>

                    <p>A pupil viewing mode is also available (in open-loop), simply by removing the pyramid optics from
                        the beam.</p>

                    <h3>Focal Plane Wavefront Sensing (FPWFS) mode</h3>


                    <p>This mode is still in an experimental phase, so notavaiable for open-use observations. The NGS is
                        reimaged on the camera, with a small defocus.This creates a phase diversity that allow us to
                        control low-order modes. This oculd be used in the future to extend the range of magntiudes
                        available, with limited performance, since we will not be albe to correct as many modes as the
                        PyWFS. It could also be used as a trut hWFS for the LGS mode, or the new LTAO instrument.</p>

                    </table>

                    <p>In this mode, the pupil lens is swapped with a reimaging lens, the pyramid optics are removed
                        from the beam, and the distance between the focusing lenses is changed to focus the light on the
                        camera. A Small defocus can be added for wavefront sensing. </p>
                    <p> If the source is focused on the detector, this mode can be used to look at the image quality (in
                        open-loop), measure the seeing or calibrate the radius of the modulation applied for the PyWFS
                        mode.</p>

                    <h2>NIR WFS dichroic beamsplitter</h2>

                    <p>The dichroic beamsplitter (DBS) for the NIR WFS is placed at the output of AO188, inside a
                        flip mount attached upside-down. It is placed at a shallow angle of 9 degree to send the light
                        to the NIR WFS. The flip mount allow to move the beamsplitter out of the way without colliding
                        with the IRD injection, but the flip mount can also be removed entirely thanks to the locating
                        pins.</p>

                    <p>
                        Several beamsplitters are available, depending on the instrument and science case. Since the
                        flip mount only accommodates one optic at a time, a choice has to be made before each observing
                        run on what beamsplitter to use. Once the Nasmyth Beam Switcher is installed, version 2 of the
                        NIR WFS will move to the LTAO WFS platform, and we will have enough space to include a mechanism
                        (wheel or linear actuator) to switch between the different options.
                    </p>

                    </center>


                    We currently offer 4 beamsplitters, which spectra in reflectance shown above :
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>K-band dichroic:</b> DBS originally designed for IRCS, but can also be used for high-res
                            K-band CHARIS observations. It sends 100% of y-, J- and H-band to the NIR WFS, 100% of
                            K-band to the science instrument.</li>
                        <li><b>YJH50 dichroic:</b> This DBS is sending 50% of y-, J- and H-band to the NIR WFS, 50% to
                            the science instrument, in addition to 100% of visible light (600-900 nm, for SCExAO only)
                            and K-band.</li>
                        <li><b>YJH90 dichroic:</b> This DBS has the same characteristics as the previous one, but
                            sending only 10% of y-, J- and H-band to the NIR WFS, 90% to the science instrument. This is
                            the most efficient option for brighter targets, without compromizing too much the efficiency
                            of the science instrument.</li>
                        <li><b>Vis-HK dichroic:</b> This DBS is sending 100% of y- and J- band to the NIR WFS, 100% of
                            the visible (for SCExAO only) and H- and K-band to the science instrument. This option
                            requires sources bright enough in J-band, instead of H-band.</li>
                    </ul>


                    <h2>Core optics</h2>

                    <p>The core optics were designed to fit the narrow space available inside AO188. Due to the small
                        field-of-view required for the instrument, we can have a small beam size and small optics. This
                        is crucial to have the propoer modulation for the PyWFS. Indeed it is harder to move a 1-inch
                        mirror at kilo-hertz speed than a ½-inch mirror. The compromize is then that the capture
                        field-of-view is not big: we can only use off-axis NGs up to 10" from the target of interest.
                    </p>

                    <p>The optics are mounted on two platforms, a narrow platform and a large plateform. The narrow

                    <ul>
                        <li>A first 2-inch fold mirror.</li>
                        <li>A 150 mm collimation lens. The lens is on a motorized translation stage to change the focus.
                        </li>
                        <li>A ½-inch modulation mirror where the pupil is reimaged. The modulation mirror is on a
                            motorized tip/tilt mount, to use off-axis stars as guide stars.</li>

                        <li>A filter wheel that can reduce the bandwidth of the WFS. It contains 3 band filters (y, K or
                            H-band), 2 dual-band filters (y+J and J+H) and an open slot.</li>
                        <li>A third 1-inch fold mirror.</li>
                        <li>A converging+diverging lens combination allows one to focus on the pyramid optics with the
                            right F/ratio while keeping a compact configuration. The diverging lens is on a motorized
                            mount to change the distance between the lenses (therefore the F/ratio), while the

                    <br>

                    <p>The camera is mounted on a platform hanging on the side of AO188, supported by brackets resting
                        against the side of the AO188 bench. This was the only possible solution due to the optical
                        path, the lack of space inside AO188, and the constraint on the shared use of the camera with
                        SCExAO FPDI mode (although this constraint will not exist once the Nasmyth Beam Switcher is
                        installed in Phase II). For alignments, the camera is mounted on a high-load lab jack for
                        vertical alignment, as well as a high-load 2-axis stage, for horizontal and focus alignment.
                        This is a duplication of the alignment mount of the FPDI, which performs very well.</p>





                    <h3>Camera Settings</h3>

                    <p>The default window size is 160x160 pixels, although the full frame (320x256 pixels) could be used
                        for the FPWFS mode. With a 160x160 pixel window, the acquisition runs at a maximum frame rate of
                        9.8 kHz. We can then use the camera in correlated double sampling (CDS) mode or non-destructive
                        read (NDR) mode to get the optimal noise level and speed, between 1 and 4.9 kHz depending on the
                        target brightness. CDS is the default mode, since the camera integrates during a whole cycle of
                        the modulator. If the modulation is not used, then NDR could be used. The detector gain can also
                        be adjusted between 1 and 121 (max) for bright targets.</p>


                    <p>The C-RED ONE camera is used in Correlated Double Sampling (CDS) mode, where the sub-frame is
                        read immediately after a frame reset, then reset and read again. The result is the difference
                        between the frame before the reset and the previous one just after the reset. The sub-frame used
                        is 160x160 pixels, with a read time of <i>t_read</i> = 102 μs. So if we program the CDS mode to
                        run at a frequency <i>F_CDS</i>, then the actual integration time <i>t_int</i> will be: </p>

                    <pre>
                        t_int = 1/F_CDS - t_read.
                    </pre>


                    In that case, we do not want the modulator to be synchronized with the CDS reads, otherwise we would
                    lose a fraction of the rotation during the actual integration time. Therefore, the modulation
                    frequency <i>F_mod</i> is set to

                    <pre>
                        F_mod = 1/t_int = F_CDS/(1-F_CDS*t_read).
                    </pre>


                    <h3>Integration time, modulator frequency and maximum modulation radius for various loop frequencies
                    </h3>

                    The Table below presents the integration time, modulator frequency and maximum modulation radius for
                    various loop frequencies.

                    The maximum frequency for CDS mode and the desired sub-window is 4.9 kHz, at which point the duty
                    cycle drops to 50%. The readout scheme creates a rolling shutter effect linked to the duty cycle
                    that is out of the scope of this page, although we will probably always be at or below 2 kHz, where
                    this effect will not impact us too much.
