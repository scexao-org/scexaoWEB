                    <p>The on-sky results presented below where taken during the engineering night of May 3, 2023. We
                        ran the AO loop at 500 Hz with the YJH50 dichroic beamsplitter (see the <a
                            href="../010technicaldescr.web/index.html">Technical description</a> page for more details).
                        The seeing was above average: 0.7 to 1.1". We observed several targets with similar magnitudes
                        in J and H. Images were recorded with SCExAO's internal SWIR camera Palila (First Light Imaging
                        C-RED 2, y- to H-band), and the CHARIS integral field spectrograph in broadband mode (J- to
                        K-band).</p>

                                        so some Strehl values can be much lower than optimal. The higher values for each

                                        Strehl ratio is over 40% until magnitude ~9, then decreases. This was done with

                    <p>The hardware latency is the time between receiving an image and the command being first applied
                        to the DM. It has to be as small as possible.
                        It is measured by sending commands to the deformable mirror with small incremental delays, and
                        measuring changes in the sensor. The ideal response would then be a triangle function with a
                        rising time corresponding to the integration time, and the hardware latency the time when we
                        reach the half-way point. This latency is independant of the loop frequency. </p>

                    <p>We measured the hardware latency to be 0.5 ms, independantly of the loop frequency as expected.
                        This corresponds to 1 frame at 2 kHz, 0.5 frame at 1 kHz and 0.25 frame at 500 Hz. This is good,
                        and should help in case of high wind. But we also noticed the strong mechanical resonance of the
                        188 DM at ~1.2 kHz, which limits the control at 1 kHz, and makes control at 2 kHz unlikely with
                        the current AO188 DM. </p>


                    <h2>Field of View (FoV)</h2>


                    <p>There are two FoVs to consider: The FoV of the wavefront sensor in a fixed position, and the FoV
                        of the instrument as a whole, including the steering capability (the patrol FoV).
                        In both PyWFS and FPWFS, the required FoV is 2.8x2.8”, defined by the control region of the
                        ALPAO 64x64 DM. It is much smaller for the 188 DM. The FoV of the PyWFS was measured at 5x6”,
                        and the FoV of the FPWFS is 4x5”.
                        The patrol FoV was measured by moving the calibration source and recentering the image using the
                        steering mirror.
                        It is over ±10” vertically, >+7 and <-20” horizontally. The range is good, but it will be
                            centered better horizontally in the future. </p>

                            <p>For IRCS's echelle spectroscopic mode, a dithering sequence is necessary to move the
                                object of interest along the slit of the spectrograph. We tested that functionnality
                                during the engineering night of May 25, 2023. We found that, due to the current design
                                of the steering/modulating mirror, the stage introduces a drift during the dithering
                                sequence, of about 50 mas per frame (see figure top right below). Since the drift seems
                                to be linear, we will remove this componant and test it in S23B, which should leave a
                                dithering error below 50 mas, without any drift. A redesign of the steering mount is
                                also in progress to improve the absolute positioning and repeatability of the steering
                                and dithering modes.</p>
