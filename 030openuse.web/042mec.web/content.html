<p>MEC, the MKID Exoplanet Camera, is an ultra-fast energy-resolving camera designed for high contrast imaging in the
	near-infrared band. It was developed in collaboration with Ben Mazin and Alex Walter among others at the <a
		href="https://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~bmazin/">University of California, Santa Barbara</a>. With 20,160 pixels,
	MEC has the largest superconducting detector array in the world and can distinguish the colors of individual photons
	at microsecond resolutions. MEC arrived on Mauna Kea, HI in March 2018 and it is now available for Open-Use
	observers.</p>

<p>MEC uses an emerging superconducting detector technology called Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKID) and
	operates at a temperature of 90 milliKelvin. Unlike conventional semi-conductor technology, MKIDs generate tens of
	thousands of free electrons when a photon breaks Cooper pairs in the superconducting circuit. This sensitivity is
	what allows the energy-resolved and noise-free detection of photon events. The custom readout electronics provide a
	continuous stream of photon arrival times to a computer essentially providing frames of arbitrarily short exposure
	time on demand.</p>


<p>MEC's purpose is to find and characterize directly imaged exoplanets in J,y,z band. In post-processing, the energy
	resolution R~8 allows for spectral differential imaging (SDI) and the extraordinary speed allows stochastic speckle
	discrimination (SSD), a promising speckle removal technique using the photon arrival time statistics to distinguish
	between speckles and companions. Most importantly, the fast noise-free continuous readout of the MKIDs allows for
	focal plane speckle control at rates high enough to track speckles with ~1s lifetimes, removing the current dominant
	noise-source in direct imaging experiments. </p>

<h2>Contrast Performance with Stochastic Speckle Discrimination (SSD)</h2>

<p> The SSD pipeline increase the SNR of detection by a factor ~3 for separations below 0.5'', compared to the total
	intensity image.</p>

<p> A contrast curve was obtained from a 15-minute dataset extrapolated to a typical observation time of 1 hour, to show
	the efficacy of the SSD technique for a long observation time. The final contrast is dependent on the speckle field
	intensity, and this example was obtained during excellent 0.35" natural seeing condition at H-band
	(diffraction-limited, SR ~>80% in H band after correction).</p>

	The MKIDS camera is being developed in collaboration with a team from the <a
		href="http://www.physics.ucsb.edu/~bmazin/">University of California, Santa Barbara</a>. It is led by Ben Mazin
	and includes Seth Meeker, Matt Strader, Julian van Eyken and others at UCSB, Rebecca Jensen-Clem at Caltech, and
	Bruce Bumble at JPL.
</p>
<p>
	The MKIDS acronym stands for Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors which are an emerging superconducting detector
	technology capable of noise-free single-photon-counting and low-resolution spectrophotometry across UV, optical, and
	near-IR wavelengths simultaneously. MKIDs have great potential as integral field units for high-contrast imaging
	experiments because they are capable of generating noise-free data cubes with arbitrarily short exposures. This
	allows speckle-reduction post-processing by Chromatic Differential Imaging and by the Dark Speckle technique, a
	promising speckle removal technique that has previously been limited by the absence of a suitable detector
	technology. Most importantly, the fast and continuous readout of MKIDs allows for focal plane speckle control at
	rates high enough to track speckles with ~1s lifetimes, removing the current dominant noise-source in direct imaging
	experiments.
</p>
<p>
	The first UVOIR MKID camera, the ARray Camera for Optical to Near-infrared Spectrophotometry (ARCONS), saw first
	light at Palomar Observatory in 2011 and has since demonstrated the first science results from any MKID camera. The
	MKID camera for SCExAO will feature an upgraded detector array, with 5x as many pixels as ARCONS, optimized for a
	target bandwidth of 0.7-1.4 microns, and an overhauled readout system integrated directly with the wavefront control
	for extremely fast focal-plane feedback.
