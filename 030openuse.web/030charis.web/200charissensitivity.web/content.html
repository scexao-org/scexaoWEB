<h1>CHARIS Sensitivity</h1> 

NOTES:
<ul>
	<li>The throughput of AO188/AO3k and SCExAO changed since this data was taken. In addition, AO performance on any particular night will affect these numbers. Strehl ratios of 60-80% were estimated when this data was taken.</li>
	<li>These results do not include the NIRWFS dichroic pickoff, or the NBS. These elements will reduce the throughput.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Broadband sensitivity</h2>

<p>Suggested starting exposure times in broadband mode for an H-magnitude=5 is 25 seconds when observing with a coronagraph.</p>

<p>Note that there is a slight shift of the PSF off of the coronagraph occulter due to chromatic residuals in the AO188 ADC. Broadband mode must always have the ADC in (ADC-in is standard for AO188).</p>

<p>The estimated zero point of CHARIS in broadband mode is H = 18.7. This will yield 1 count/s/spectral channel.</p>
