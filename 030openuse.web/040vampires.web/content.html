<h1>VAMPIRES</h1>

<p>
  The Visible Aperture Masking Polarimetric Imager for Resolved Exoplanetary
  Structures (VAMPIRES) is a visible-light, dual-camera instrument on the SCExAO platform.

<h2>Notes for observers</h2>

<h3 style="color: red">S25A NIRWFS PDI</h3>
<p>
In S25A we are opening VAMPIRES polarimetry for shared-risk use with the AO3k near-infrared wavefront sensor (<a href="https://www.naoj.org/Projects/SCEXAO/scexaoWEB/nearIRWFS/index.html">NIRWFS</a>). <a href="figures/nirwfs_polarization.png">Internal polarization calibrations</a> indicate the NIRWFS pickoff affects polarimetry up to ~5%. Observers must consult with the SCExAO team for their proposals to discuss instrument polarization calibrations.
</p>

<hr />

<h3 style="color: orange">Data Processing</h3>

<p>
An experimental data-processing pipeline is available on <a href="https://github.com/scexao-org/vampires_dpp">GitHub</a>. This pipeline can calibrate, register, and coadd frames with additional support for imaging polarimetry. It is compatible with the previous generation of VAMPIRES and the upgraded VAMPIRES. It is not compatible with NRM, yet.

    href="https://www.hamamatsu.com/us/en/product/cameras/qcmos-cameras/C15550-20UP.html"
    >Hamamatsu Orca-QUEST qCMOS detectors</a
  >. These detectors allow high-framerate, low read-noise imaging with very few
  cosmetics. Because these are CMOS detectors, there is significant
  fixed-pattern noise so we highly recommend taking standard flat field and dark
  calibrations.

<h2>Multi-band Imaging (MBI)</h2>

<p>
  In S23B we deployed a new multi-band imaging (MBI) mode which uses a
  stack of dichroics at slightly offset angles of incidence to form multiple
  images across the detectors. A schematic of the principle is shown below. This
  mode is compatible with all observing modes except the narrowband spectral
  differential mode.

<h2>Polarimetry</h2>

<p>
  VAMPIRES has two different polarimetry modes: "slow" mode, which uses an
  upstream half-wave plate (HWP) to slowly modulate the polarization state and
  "fast" mode, which includes a fast achromatic liquid crystal (AFLC) to quickly
  modulate the signal. For both modes the light is split by a polarizing
  beamsplitter cube to simultaneously measure orthogonal polarization states on
  each camera. Note: the HWP is upstream from AO188, which requires
  synchronization if you want to operate in PDI mode simultaneously with other
  SCExAO instruments. Currently the HWP can be synced across VAMPIRES, FastPDI,
  and CHARIS.
</p>

      <td>Slow</td>

      <td>
        AFLC requires exposure times &lt;1s. Uses triple-difference method.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Data-processing and calibration</h3>
<p>
  VAMPIRES uses double-difference for slow polarimetry mode and
  triple-difference for the fast mode. The instrumental polarization is
  calibrated using an empirical Mueller matrix model fit to polarized flat
  fields. We recommend observing a polarized and unpolarized standard star
  during your observations if polarimetric accuracy is paramount.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>Coronagraphy</h2>

<p>
  VAMPIRES is equipped with a classic Lyot coronagraph with the combination of a
  focal-plane mask and a pupil stop. The coronagraph can be used with any
  full-pupil observing mode (i.e., cannot be used with the sparse aperture
  masks). For moderately faint targets (9 &lt I &lt 11 mag) the coronagraph can
  be deployed without the Lyot stop to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio at the
  cost of diffraction control (e.g., protoplanetary disk imaging).

<h3>Calibration</h3>

<p>
  Calibration is performed via artifical speckles generated by the deformable
  mirror which have a known angular offset and differential photometry compared
  to the star. This allows astrometric and photometric calibration of the star
  behind the focal plane mask.

<h2>Sparse Aperture Masking</h2>

  Sparse aperture masking (SAM) allows the full diffraction limit of the
  telescope to be recovered by using selected sub-pupils of the telescope pupil
  as interferometer baselines. See, for example, Tuthill, et al. (2000), PASP,
  112, 555; Huelamo, et al., (2011), A&A, 528, L7; Kraus & Ireland, (2012), ApJ,

<h3>Calibration</h3>
<p>
  Calibration is performed via the observation of a PSF calibrator star, as per
  the conventional sparse aperture-masking methodology. This mode is ideal for
  the detection of faint companions and unpolarized circumstellar structure at
  very close separations (10s of mas).
</p>

<h2>Narrowband / Spectral Differential Imaging</h2>

<p>
  Simultaneous spectral differential imaging (SDI) using either H-alpha or SII
  lines can be performed. Imaging is performed simultaneously on two cameras via
  a non-polarizing beamsplitter, with an H-alpha (or SII) filter before one
  camera and an adjacent continuum filter before the other. Filters can be
  rapidly swapped between cameras to help calibrate non common path errors. This
  mode may be used with both aperture-masking and full-pupil imaging and is
  compatible with polarimetry.
</p>

<p>
  Current contrast limits are 1e-3 at 50 mas and 1e-4 at &gt;350 mas (Feb.
  2019). Note this mode is in continuous development and contrast limits are
  expected to further improve.

<p>
  The Visible Aperture Masking Polarimetric Interferometer for Resolving
  Exoplanetary Signatures (VAMPIRES) instrument draws on the established success
  of sparse aperture masking interferometry (also known as non-redundant
  masking) and combines it with differential polarimetry, to provide diffraction
  limited scattered-light imaging of circumstellar environments. Primary science
  targets include protoplanetary disks as well as the mass-loss shells of
  evolved stars. It is being developed in collaboration with a team from the
  University of Sydney, Australia, consisting of Peter Tuthill, Barnaby Norris,
  Guillaume Schworer and Paul Stewart.
</p>
<p>
  Sparse aperture masking (SAM) allows the full diffraction limit of the
  telescope to be recovered by using selected sub-pupils of the telescope pupil
  as interferometer baselines. See, for example, Tuthill, et al. (2000), PASP,
  112, 555; Huelamo, et al., (2011), A&A, 528, L7; Kraus & Ireland, (2012), ApJ,
  745, 5. The addition of differential polarimetry allows SAM’s differential
  observables to be far more precisely calibrated, while providing polarization
  information of the target.
</p>
<p>
  In a technique complementary to infrared coronagraphy, VAMPIRES provides an
  effective inner-working-angle at 600 to 800 nm of ~10 mas, depending on the
  contrast ratio. A comprehensive description of the instrument is given in
  Norris, et al. (2015), MNRAS, 447, 3. The science potential of VAMPIRES’ core
  technique - differential polarimetric spare aperture masking - is demonstrated
  in Norris, et al., (2012), Nature, 484, 220.
</p>
<p>
  An instrument schematic is given below. Three tiers of differential
  calibration allow interferometric visibilities to be calibrated to 0.1%, and
  closure phases to better than a degree. In its primary mode (with masks and
  the polarimeter), VAMPIRES offers spatial resolution at the diffraction limit
  (<10 mas), while having a relatively small field-of-view — around ~500 mas —
  as defined by the shortest baseline. The sensitivity of VAMPIRES observations
  in the primary mode is determined by the contrast ratio between the unresolved
  stellar flux and the overall scattered-light flux from the circumstellar dust.
  As a guide, a star:disk contrast ratio of 1000:1 provides a 1 sigma detection
  on a single baseline. Depending on the aperture mask employed, typically
  hundreds or even thousands of baselines (in the case of the annular mask) are
  measured.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the primary differential-polarized SAM mode, VAMPIRES also
  offers several additional modes: conventional masking mode (non-polarized) and
  a polarized imaging mode (full pupil, no masks).
</p>

<p>
  VAMPIRES can operate simultaneously with SCExAO/HiCIAO NIR observations. While
  wavelengths > 1μm are sent to SCExAO’s IR channel and HiCIAO, shorter
  wavelengths are sent to the SCExAO visible channel (including the pyramid WFS)
  and VAMPIRES.
</p>
<p>
  The data product produced by VAMPIRES is a set of differential interferometric
  Visibilities and Closure Phases. The team at the University of Sydney provide
  expertise in interpretation of these data, including model-fitting. An example
  data set is shown in the figure below.
