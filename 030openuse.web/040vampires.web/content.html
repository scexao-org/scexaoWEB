<h1>VAMPIRES</h1>

<p>The Visible Aperture Masking Polarimetric Imager for Resolved Exoplanetary Structures (VAMPIRES) is a visible-light instrument on the SCExAO system. See <a href="2018_VAMPIRES.pdf">this presentation</a> for an overview of VAMPIRES (2018).

<h2>Note for observers: VAMPIRES Upgrades (S23B)</h2>

<p>VAMPIRES will be undergoing significant upgrades in June 2023, prior to the 23B observing semester. These upgrades will improve the sensitivity, speed, and dynamic range of the instrument in addition to the addition of a multi-band imaging mode. The core of the VAMPIRES upgrade are the switch from <a href="https://andor.oxinst.com/products/ixon-emccd-camera-series/ixon-ultra-897">EM-CCD detectors</a> to <a href="https://www.hamamatsu.com/us/en/product/cameras/qcmos-cameras/C15550-20UP.html">ultra-low read noise CMOS detectors</a>.</p>

<p>All current modes of VAMPIRES will be supported in shared-risk mode:
<ul>
  <li>Full-pupil speckle imaging</li>
  <li>Sparse aperture mask interferometry</li>
  <li>Polarized differential imaging</li>
  <li>Spectral differential imaging</li>
</ul>
in addition to a new multi-band imaging (MBI) mode.</p>

<p>New calibrations will be done to fully characterize the system, including zero-points, contrast curves, polarimetric efficiency, and astrometric calibration. Observers are recommended to get in contact with the SCExAO team if proposing for VAMPIRES in S23B (cc <a href="mailto:mdlucas@hawaii.edu">Miles Lucas</a>).</p>

<p>These CMOS cameras are capable of photon counting in the low read noise "slow" mode. The plot below shows a photon counting histogram fit to an 800x256 pixel subwindow in slow mode. Being able to separate the peaks in the Poisson distribution allows a read-noise-free estimate of ultra-low signals (in this case, 0.744 e-).</p>

<h3>Multi-band imaging (MBI)</h3>

<p>In S23B we will be testing a new multi-band imaging (MBI) mode which uses a stack of dichroics at slightly offset angles of incidence to form multiple images across the detectors. A schematic of the principle is shown below. This mode will be compatible with all observing modes except the spectral differential mode.</p>

<h2>Polarimetry</h2>

<p>VAMPIRES uses a triple-differential polarization calibration methodology comprising of a polarizing beamsplitter, a fast ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC), and an achromatic half-wave plate (HWP). The HWP switches every cube (~30-60 s), the FLC switches every other frame (~50 Hz), and the beamsplitter allows simultaneous measurement of both polarization states by each camera. Note that the HWP is in AO188, which means you cannot use other instruments on SCExAO without also using their polarimetric modes. The HWP can be synced across FastPDI and CHARIS.</p>

<h2>Coronagraphy</h2>

<p>VAMPIRES is equipped with a classic Lyot coronagraph with the combination of a focal-plane mask and a pupil stop. The coronagraph can be used with any full-pupil observing mode (i.e., cannot be used with the sparse aperture masks). For moderately bright targets (6 &lt I &lt 8 mag) the coronagraph can be deployed without the Lyot stop to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio at the cost of diffraction control (e.g., protoplanetary disk imaging). See the <a href="./100vampcoronagraph.web/indexm.html">coronagraph section</a> for more details.</p>

    <td>Setup time</td>
    <td>5 minutes</td>
    <td>This includes fine adjustments to the focus and alignment of the focal plane and pupil masks.</td>

<h3>Calibration</h3>

<p>Calibration is performed via artifical speckles generated by the deformable mirror which have a known angular offset and differential photometry compared to the star. This allows astrometric and photometric calibration of the star behind the focal plane mask.</p>

<h2>Sparse Aperture Masking</h2>

<p>Sparse aperture masking (SAM) allows the full diffraction limit of the telescope to be recovered by using selected sub-pupils of the telescope pupil as interferometer baselines. See, for example, Tuthill, et al. (2000), PASP, 112, 555; Huelamo, et al., (2011), A&A, 528, L7; Kraus & Ireland, (2012), ApJ, 745, 5.</p>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7 hole (I ~ 7)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Calibration</h3>
<p>Calibration is performed via the observation of a PSF calibrator star, as per the conventional sparse aperture-masking methodology. This mode is ideal for the detection of faint companions and unpolarized circumstellar structure at very close separations (10s of mas).</p>

<h2>Spectral Differential Imaging</h2>

<p>Simultaneous spectral differential imaging (SDI) using either H-alpha or SII lines can be performed. Imaging is performed simultaneously on two cameras via a non-polarizing beamsplitter, with an H-alpha (or SII) filter before one camera and an adjacent continuum filter before the other. Filters can be rapidly swapped between cameras to help calibrate non common path errors. This mode may be used with both aperture-masking and full-pupil imaging. Note this mode is in continuous development and contrast limits are expected to further improve.</p>

<h2>VAMPIRES instrument description</h2>
  <p>
  The Visible Aperture Masking Polarimetric Interferometer for Resolving Exoplanetary Signatures (VAMPIRES) instrument draws on the established success of sparse aperture masking interferometry (also known as non-redundant masking) and combines it with differential polarimetry, to provide diffraction limited scattered-light imaging of circumstellar environments. Primary science targets include protoplanetary disks as well as the mass-loss shells of evolved stars. It is being developed in collaboration with a team from the University of Sydney, Australia, consisting of Peter Tuthill, Barnaby Norris, Guillaume Schworer and Paul Stewart.
  </p>
  <p>
  Sparse aperture masking (SAM) allows the full diffraction limit of the telescope to be recovered by using selected sub-pupils of the telescope pupil as interferometer baselines. See, for example, Tuthill, et al. (2000), PASP, 112, 555; Huelamo, et al., (2011), A&A, 528, L7; Kraus & Ireland, (2012), ApJ, 745, 5. The addition of differential polarimetry allows SAM’s differential observables to be far more precisely calibrated, while providing polarization information of the target.
  </p>
  <p>
  In a technique complementary to infrared coronagraphy, VAMPIRES provides an effective inner-working-angle at 600 to 800 nm of ~10 mas, depending on the contrast ratio. A comprehensive description of the instrument is given in Norris, et al. (2015), MNRAS, 447, 3. The science potential of VAMPIRES’ core technique - differential polarimetric spare aperture masking - is demonstrated in Norris, et al., (2012), Nature, 484, 220.
  </p>
  <p>
  An instrument schematic is given below. Three tiers of differential calibration allow interferometric visibilities to be calibrated to 0.1%, and closure phases to better than a degree. In its primary mode (with masks and the polarimeter), VAMPIRES offers spatial resolution at the diffraction limit (<10 mas), while having a relatively small field-of-view — around ~500 mas — as defined by the shortest baseline. The sensitivity of VAMPIRES observations in the primary mode is determined by the contrast ratio between the unresolved stellar flux and the overall scattered-light flux from the circumstellar dust. As a guide, a star:disk contrast ratio of 1000:1 provides a 1 sigma detection on a single baseline. Depending on the aperture mask employed, typically hundreds or even thousands of baselines (in the case of the annular mask) are measured.
  </p>
  <p>
  In addition to the primary differential-polarized SAM mode, VAMPIRES also offers several additional modes: conventional masking mode (non-polarized) and a polarized imaging mode (full pupil, no masks).
  <p>
  VAMPIRES can operate simultaneously with SCExAO/HiCIAO NIR observations. While wavelengths > 1μm are sent to SCExAO’s IR channel and HiCIAO, shorter wavelengths are sent to the SCExAO visible channel (including the pyramid WFS) and VAMPIRES.
  </p>
  <p>
  The data product produced by VAMPIRES is a set of differential interferometric Visibilities and Closure Phases. The team at the University of Sydney provide expertise in interpretation of these data, including model-fitting. An example data set is shown in the figure below.
