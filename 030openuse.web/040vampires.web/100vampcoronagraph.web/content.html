<h1>VAMPIRES Coronagraph</h1>

<p>Coronagraphic mode allows for deep high contrast observations </p>


<h2>Important information for observers</h2>
<p>
  The coronagraph only works in conventional imaging mode, that is, without any sub-pupil masks. The coronagraph works in normal imaging, as well as polarimetric differential imaging mode. No field stops can be used while using the coronagraph.
  It takes ~5 minutes to place and align the focal plane mask and Lyot stop. Currently, coronagraphic imaging with VAMPIRES is well-suited for <i>optically-bright</i> targets, where the coronagraph improves the effective dynamic range in conjunction with the electron-multiplycing CCDs that VAMPIRES employs.

<p>
  We recommend coordinating the SCExAO team if you plan to use the coronagraph for your observations. This ensures we have the masks well-aligned in preparation for the night to minimize downtime. The PI for the coronagraph mode is Miles Lucas (<a href="mailto:mdlucas@hawaii.edu">mdlucas@hawaii.edu</a>).

<h2>Coronagraph description</h2>
  <p>
  VAMPIRES coronagraph is a classic Lyot-type coronagraph, consisting of a circular, hard-edge focal plane mask and a Lyot stop. The Lyot stop is reflective to allow for precise alignment using reflected starlight. Available mask sizes are 3, 5 and 7 lambda/D (at 750nm). Focal plane masks have a 1e-3 transmission for alignment.

 <h2>Measured contrast</h2>
  
  <p>Raw contrast curves measured with the calibration source (off-sky) without speckle control. These raw contrast values can be approached on-sky under excellent conditions (bright star, good seeing).</p>

<h2>Calibration</h2>

<p>Coronagraphic images photometry and astrometry can be calibrated by using astrogrid DM modulation to create satellite spots of known position and flux relative to the PSF core.</p>
