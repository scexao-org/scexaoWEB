<h1>VAMPIRES Coronagraph</h1>

<p>Coronagraphic mode allows for deep, high-contrast observations </p>


<h2>Important information for observers</h2>
<p>
  The coronagraph only works in conventional imaging mode, that is, without any sub-pupil masks. The coronagraph works
  in normal imaging, as well as polarimetric differential imaging mode. No field stops can be used while using the
  coronagraph.
  It takes ~5 minutes to place and align the focal plane mask and Lyot stop. Currently, coronagraphic imaging with
  VAMPIRES is well-suited for <i>optically-bright</i> targets, where the coronagraph improves the effective dynamic
  range in conjunction with the electron-multiplying CCDs that VAMPIRES employs.
</p>

<p>
  We recommend coordinating the SCExAO team if you plan to use the coronagraph for your observations. This ensures we
  have the masks well-aligned in preparation for the night to minimize downtime. The PI for the coronagraph mode is
  Miles Lucas (<a href="mailto:mdlucas@hawaii.edu">mdlucas@hawaii.edu</a>).

<h2>Coronagraph description</h2>
<p>
  VAMPIRES coronagraph is a classic Lyot-style coronagraph, consisting of a circular, hard-edge focal plane mask and a
  Lyot stop. Available mask sizes are 36, 55, 92, or 129 mas, which corresponds to roughly 2, 3, 5 and 7 lambda/D (calculated at 750nm). Focal plane masks have a 0.06% transmission for alignment and calibration. The Lyot stop is reflective to allow for precise alignment and is
  undersized compared to the SCExAO pupil (relative throughput is 65.7%).

<h2>Measured contrast</h2>

<h3>Testbed</h3>
<p>Raw contrast curves measured with the calibration source (off-sky) without speckle control. These raw contrast values
  can be approached on-sky under excellent conditions (bright star, good seeing). At 0.1", the 5-sigma raw contrast (median noise per annulus) is around 1e2, and at separations >0.8" is around 1e5.</p>

  <p>
    <small>
      Raw 5-sigma contrast curves measured on the SCExAO testbed. These curves account for small-sample statistics and have no PSF subtraction. The black curve is the non-coronagraphic contrast measured from a saturated PSF (which has been masked out), while the orange through purple curves correspond to each focal plane mask. The IWA for each curve is marked with a dotted vertical line. The astrogrid speckles are also masked out.

<h2>Calibration</h2>

<p>In coronagraphic images photometry and astrometry can be calibrated by using astrogrid DM modulation to create
  satellite spots of known position and flux relative to the PSF core.</p>
