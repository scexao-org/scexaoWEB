		<h2>SCExAO instrument publication and citation policies</h2>
		</center>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		
		<p>Thank you for using or considering using SCExAO for your science and instrumentation projects. Unlike other high contrast imagers, SCExAO benefits from a unique development model that uses feedback from its users and regular hardware and software upgrades. SCExAO is therefore a continuously evolving testbed whose capabilities and performance are improving over time, so as to maximize scientific return. Much of this effort is carried out by collaborations with groups outside NAOJ/Subaru Telescope that have been helping shape SCExAO the way it stands today. The SCExAO team is committed to providing the high contrast imaging/exoplanet community with a welcoming environment for instrumentation development/prototyping and create opportunities for new scientific discoveries. </p>
		<p>The SCExAO publication policies described on this page are aimed at (1) ensuring that adequate credit is given to those who have developed instrument capabilities that are critical to its scientific performance and (2) promote scientific and technical collaborations between observers and the instrument team. These policies will makes it possible to sustain the SCExAO instrument development model. Please do not hesitate to contact the SCExAO team if you have any questions, suggestions or concerns.</p>

<h3>Work published by members of the post-SEEDs community</h3>
		<p>
		Data, collected with the aid of the SCExAO instrument, which leads to a publication by post-SEEDs community members, should include the core instrument build team (Olivier Guyon, Nemanja Jovanovic, Julien Lozi, and Frantz Martinache) as co-authors. Other members of the extended SCExAO team, which includes PI instruments/sub-modules (defined in the table below), should be included based on their involvement in the work and which modules are used. The core instrument team will assist the post-SEEDs community identify individuals/groups who should be part of the author list.</p>

<h3>Guideline for non-post-SEEDs observers using SCExAO and modules</h3>
		<p>
		SCExAO is a continuously evolving PI instrument. Instrument operation, data collection and to a large extent data reduction requires significant involvement of the instrument team, especially for efficient use of recently added capabilities. The core instrument team and members of other PI instrument/sub-modules (which include CHARIS, MEC, HiCIAO, VAMPIRES, FIRST, RHEA, SAPHIRA, etc.) are committed to supporting observers to achieve their goals. The team provides assistance with data reduction and data calibration using advanced techniques and tools that are continuously improved, using for example instrument wavefront sensor telemetry to enhance data processing. This process is also critical to guide the instrument development: working closely with observers is essential to identify and address any issue or limitations that affect its scientific performance. </p>
		<p>
For these reasons, observers are encouraged to work closely with the core SCExAO team (Olivier Guyon, Nemanja Jovanovic, Julien Lozi, and Frantz Martinache), as well as any other members of PI Instruments/sub-module teams that may be used, in order to ensure optimal data product quality. The observers are also encouraged to consider using capabilities and modules they may not be familiar with, to broaden and increase the scientific reach of their observations (for example, visible light polarimetric imaging with VAMPIRES can be conducted simultaneously with near-IR coronagraphic imaging of the same disk). </p>
		<p>
To reflect and facilitate the instrument team’s strong involvement in the production of scientific data, observers are encouraged to list the core SCExAO team members and appropriate PI Instrument/sub-module team members as co-authors in scientific publications. While observers may opt for a narrower author list, the SCExAO team favors an inclusive approach that encourages close collaboration between observers and instrument teams. This practice will help sustain the instrument development model and keep leading to improved data of higher quality.
</p> 

<h3>Instrumentation and observation work published by visitor module teams (RHEA, VAMPIRES, FIRST, SAPHIRA, GLINT, coronagraphs and wavefront control collaborations)
</h3>
		<p>
		The SCExAO instrument is a flexible platform for high contrast imaging, designed to welcome visitor instrument modules that provide significant scientific value to the exoplanet community. The core instrument team is committed to providing a welcoming environment to visitor modules. The SCExAO core team devotes a significant fraction of its time and resources to foster valuable collaborations with visitor instrument teams and promote a stimulating research environment in advanced instrumentation and scientific research. </p>
		<p>
To reflect and promote the close relationship between the SCExAO core team and visitor module teams, publications by visitor module teams (VAMPIRES, RHEA, etc) based on data acquired on the SCExAO platform should include the core instrument team (Olivier Guyon, Nemanja Jovanovic, Julien Lozi, and Frantz Martinache) as co-authors. Other members of the SCExAO team should be included based on their involvement in the work.
 </p>
		<p>
The core SCExAO team, in agreement and close coordination with a visitor module team, can work toward offering the visitor module’s use to external observers. The visitor module team will be given full credit (see section “Guideline for non-post-SEEDs observers using SCExAO and modules”).
