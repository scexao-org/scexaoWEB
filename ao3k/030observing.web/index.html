                    <p>
                        If you want to use the AO3k/NIRWFS, you need to find a Natural
                        Guide Star (NGS) that is bright enough at less than 14" separation from
                        your target of interest. The target of interest can be the NGS itself if
                        it is a bright enough stellar object. Non-sidereal tracking is currently
                        not available with NIRWFS.</p>

                    <p> Read the following instructions <i>carefully</i> if you wish to
                        apply for observing time with AO188. <b>If technical details described
                            in your proposal are incomplete, it may be rejected even if your

                    <h3>Magnitude Limit</h3>


                    Magnitude limits listed in this section are for the AO correction to deliver 0.1 arcsec FWHM in
                    median conditions.
                    AO correction perfomance at the faint limit is strongly affected by atmospheric conditions,
                    including turbulence coherence time.
                    Magnitude values are calculated for A-type stars with flat spectra. Very red objects will be limited
                    by the H-band magnitude
                    limit before the broadband magnitude limit.
                    <p><b>The values presented here were measured with the first design of the NIRWFS. The upgrade in S25B will change these values, and a new binning mode should improve the magnitude limit to about one magnitude, but this mode might not yet be available in S26A.</b></p>

                    <h3>Separation for off-axis NGS</h3>

                    <p>
                        If the science target is too faint, then you need to select a bright NGS that is no more than
                        14" away from it. This limitation is due to the capture field-of-view of the NIRWFS (See <a
                            href="../020performance.web/index.html">Performance</a> for more details).
                    </p>

                    <h3>Extended objects and binaries</h3>

                    <p>
                        The pyramid WFS design is not ideal for extended objects and binaries. For extended sources, if
                        the source is too extended (more than a few arcseconds), the loop cannot close. For smaller
                        objects, we can close the loop, but with degraded performances. For binaries, results can vary
                        depending on the separation and H-band contrast between the two stars. Separations over ~3"
                        should have no impact whatever the contrast is, and similarly, contrasts over ~5 should also
                        have no impact whatever the separation is. For separations between 1 and 3", a low-contrast
                        binary will be difficult to observe, due to the added light of the companion inside the
                        wavefront sensor. If the separation is closer, we have more chances to close the loop, although
                        the performances might be affected.
                    </p>

                    <p><b>A new adaptive field stop will be added in S25B, and should improve the capacity to close the loop for binaries and crowded fields.</b></p>

                    <h2>3. Planning dates of observations </h2>

                    Evaluate possible dates of your observations based on the following tips:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b> Elevation </b>
                            --- We recommend you to observe targets at an elevation of 45<sup>o</sup> or larger. Strehl
                            ratios and/or FWHMs can significantly be degraded at lower elevations. Please not that the
                            atmospheric dispersion corrector (ADC) installed at the science path, or the wavefront
                            sensor do not guarantee good correction for elevations below 30<sup>o</sup>.</li>

                        <li><b> Distance to the moon </b>
                            --- We cannot perform AO correction if the sky is very bright. We then recommend you to
                            observe the target at least 10<sup>o</sup> apart from the moon.
                    </ul>

                    <a name="overheads"></a>
                    <h2>4. Overheads </h2>

                    We usually need 10-15 minutes for overheads of each target. These include acquisition of the AO
                    guide star, optimization of AO, and acquisition of the target. You may omit the optimization step if
                    the guide star magnitude and separation are similar to that used just before your observations and
                    the weather condition has not been changed. Add 5 minutes if the NGS is off-axis. In addition to
                    these, we need up to 12 minutes to slew the telescope to your target.
