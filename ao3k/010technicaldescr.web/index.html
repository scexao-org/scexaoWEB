                    <h2>Upgrade of AO188 to AO3k</h2>

                    The deployment of the NIRWFS happened in phases:
                    <li><b>Phase Ia:</b> In this phase, the NIRWFS was mounted inside AO188, and controlled AO188's
                        188-element bimorph deformable mirror (DM). This phase was implemented from May 2023 to May 2024.</li>
                    <li><b>Phase Ib:</b> In this phase, the NIRWFS is in the same place, but we upgraded AO188's DM with an
                        ALPAO 64x64 DM, increasing the number of actuators in the pupil to about 3000. AO188 then
                        became AO3k. This phse was implemented from May 2024 to July 2025.</li>
                    <li><b>Phase II:</b> In this phase, A new Nasmyth Beam Switcher (NBS) is installed behind
                        AO188/AO3k, allowing to send the light to any available instrument on the Nasmyth IR platform of
                        Subaru. At that point, a new LTAO mode is also added between AO188 and the NBS, and the NIR
                        WFS migrates outside the AO188 enclosure to a shared platform with the LTAO mode.</li>
                    <p>

                    <h2>Description of the NIRWFS in Phase II</h2>

                    <p>
                        In Phase II, the NIRWFS is installed at the output port of AO188/AO3k, on the LTAO platform. Compared 
                        to the phase I design (described below), the phase II design has more space to utilize, allowing to 
                        add a few usueful features:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>A dichroic beamsplitter wheel:</b> this motorized wheel allows us to change dichroics when 
                            needed, even between targets in the same observation. This is an improvement from the previous
                        design, where only one dichroic was available per observating night.</li>
                        <li><b>A NIR acquisition camera:</b> A small NIR camera is added inside the instrument, to aquire the
                        taregts more efficiently. This camera reduces the overhead between targets, and allows to measure
                        the seeing routinely between targets.</li>
                        <li><b>An adaptive field stop:</b> The NIRWFS struggles to close the loop if one or several other
                        bright stars are preseent in the field of view of the sensor. This field stop will block the light
                        from these stars to reach the camera. Its size can be adjusted depending on the position on the other
                        stars. </li>
                        <li><b>An optical binning mode:</b> Another pupil lens configuration is added to reduce the size of the
                        four pupils on the camera by a factor two. This means that the light is more concentrated on each 
                        pupil, which should increase the magnitude limit by almost two magnitudes. However, in this mode, we
                        cannot control as many modes, so the performance will not be as high as the regular PyWFS mode.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Pyramid Wavefront Sensing (PyWFS) mode</h3>


                    <p>The PyWFS mode is the main mode of the NIRWFS, and the only one offered for Open-Use observations for
                        now. The light coming from the AO3k bench is partly reflected by the dichroic beamsplitter right after
                        the focal plane while the rest of the light goes towards the science instruments. In the wavefront
                        sensor, the reflected light goes through a collimator, with a focal length of 150 mm. A first fold
                        mirror sends the light to a small 1/2 mirror located in a pupil plane, glued on a 3-axis piezo-electric
                        mount use to modulate the beam at several hundred hertz. The mount is itself attached to two rotation
                        mounts used to steer the guide star in the wavefront sensor. The light is then reflected by a second
                        fold mirror and goes through a filter wheel. The filter wheel can select what band or combination of 
                        bands go to the camera, with an open slot as the default position. The light is reflected again by a 
                        third fold mirror towards focusing optics. The first lens is a concave lens with a 150 mm focal length,
                        identical to the collimation lens. The second lens is a convex lens with a focal length of -50 mm,
                        creating a F/40 beam on the pyramid optics. A pickoff mirror can be inserted between the two lenses to
                        send the light to the NIR acquisition camera, a First Light Imaging C-RED2. The beam on the camera is
                        F/13.9, the same as the output of AO3k. The plate scale is then ~56 mas per pixel, and the field of
                        view is then 36x28 arcsec. With the pickoff out, the light focuses on the tip of the pyramid optics, a 
                        double roof prism design. It splits the light into four beams. The new adaptive field stop is placed 
                        right after the prisms, as it was not possible to put it in the focal plane. Finaly, a 80 mm pupil
                        lens image the four pupils on the First Light Imaging C-RED ONE camera. A second set of lenses (two
                        100 mm lenses) can be inserted instead, for the optical binning mode.</p>

                    <h3>Focal Plane Wavefront Sensing (FPWFS) mode</h3>


                    <p>This mode is still in an experimental phase, so not avaiable for open-use observations. The NGS is
                        reimaged on the camera, with a small defocus.This creates a phase diversity that allow us to
                        control low-order modes. This could be used in the future to extend the range of magntiudes
                        available, with limited performance, since we will not be albe to correct as many modes as the
                        PyWFS. It could also be used as a truth hWFS for the new LTAO instrument.</p>

                    <p>In this mode, the pupil lens is swapped with a reimaging lens, the pyramid optics are removed
                        from the beam, and the distance between the focusing lenses is changed to focus the light on the
                        camera. A Small defocus can be added for wavefront sensing. </p>
                    <p> If the source is focused on the detector, this mode can be used to look at the image quality (in
                        open-loop), measure the seeing or calibrate the radius of the modulation applied for the PyWFS
                        mode.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Dichroic beamsplitters</h3>
                    <p>
                        Several beamsplitters are available, depending on the instrument and science case. Since the
                        flip mount only accommodates one optic at a time, a choice has to be made before each observing
                        run on what beamsplitter to use. Once the Nasmyth Beam Switcher is installed, version 2 of the
                        NIRWFS will move to the LTAO WFS platform, and we will have enough space to include a mechanism
                        (wheel or linear actuator) to switch between the different options.
                    </p>

                    </center>


                    We currently offer 4 beamsplitters, which spectra in reflectance shown above:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>K-band dichroic:</b> DBS originally designed for IRCS, but can also be used for high-res
                            K-band CHARIS observations. It sends 100% of y-, J- and H-band to the NIRWFS, 100% of
                            K-band to the science instrument.</li>
                        <li><b>YJH50 dichroic:</b> This DBS is sending 50% of y-, J- and H-band to the NIRWFS, 50% to
                            the science instrument, in addition to 100% of visible light (600-900 nm, for SCExAO only)
                            and K-band.</li>
                        <li><b>YJH90 dichroic:</b> This DBS has the same characteristics as the previous one, but
                            sending only 10% of y-, J- and H-band to the NIRWFS, 90% to the science instrument. This is
                            the most efficient option for brighter targets, without compromizing too much the efficiency
                            of the science instrument.</li>
                        <li><b>Vis-HK dichroic:</b> This DBS is sending 100% of y- and J- band to the NIRWFS, 100% of
                            the visible (for SCExAO only) and H- and K-band to the science instrument. This option
                            requires sources bright enough in J-band, instead of H-band.</li>
                    </ul>


                    
                    
                    <h3>Camera Settings</h3>

                    <p>The default window size is 160x160 pixels, although the full frame (320x256 pixels) could be used
                        for the FPWFS mode. With a 160x160 pixel window, the acquisition runs at a maximum frame rate of
                        9.8 kHz. We can then use the camera in correlated double sampling (CDS) mode or non-destructive
                        read (NDR) mode to get the optimal noise level and speed, between 1 and 4.9 kHz depending on the
                        target brightness. CDS is the default mode, since the camera integrates during a whole cycle of
                        the modulator. If the modulation is not used, then NDR could be used. The detector gain can also
                        be adjusted between 1 and 121 (max) for bright targets.</p>


                    <p>The C-RED ONE camera is used in Correlated Double Sampling (CDS) mode, where the sub-frame is
                        read immediately after a frame reset, then reset and read again. The result is the difference
                        between the frame before the reset and the previous one just after the reset. The sub-frame used
                        is 160x160 pixels, with a read time of <i>t_read</i> = 102 μs. So if we program the CDS mode to
                        run at a frequency <i>F_CDS</i>, then the actual integration time <i>t_int</i> will be: </p>

                    <pre>
                        t_int = 1/F_CDS - t_read.
                    </pre>


                    In that case, we do not want the modulator to be synchronized with the CDS reads, otherwise we would
                    lose a fraction of the rotation during the actual integration time. Therefore, the modulation
                    frequency <i>F_mod</i> is set to

                    <pre>
                        F_mod = 1/t_int = F_CDS/(1-F_CDS*t_read).
                    </pre>


                    <h3>Integration time, modulator frequency and maximum modulation radius for various loop frequencies
                    </h3>

                    The Table below presents the integration time, modulator frequency and maximum modulation radius for
                    various loop frequencies.

                    The maximum frequency for CDS mode and the desired sub-window is 4.9 kHz, at which point the duty
                    cycle drops to 50%. The readout scheme creates a rolling shutter effect linked to the duty cycle
                    that is out of the scope of this page, although we will probably always be at or below 2 kHz, where
                    this effect will not impact us too much.

                    <h2>Description of the NIRWFS in Phases Ia & Ib</h2>

                    In Phase I of the deployment of the NIRWFS, the optics fit inside AO188, while the C-RED
                    ONE camera was mounted on the side of the instrument. This was due to a lack of space inside AO188.
                    The camera had to be removable, since a collision is possible with SCExAO's own C-RED ONE camera
                    used for the FPDI mode. Therefore, in phase I, it wwas not be possible to have both cameras at the
                    same time. Figure 5 presents the position for the optics and the camera. The
                    dichroic beamsplitter sending some light to the NIR PyWFS was designed to be compatible with science
                    observation with IRCS, especially K-band spectroscopy.

                        four
                        beams in the pupil plane. The PyWFS is used to control the wavefront with the deformable mirror

                    <p>
                    A dichroic beamsplitter pickoff is placed in the output beam of AO188, selecting some of the light
                    that goes to the NIRWFS. The light is reflected by a first fold mirror, then collimated by a
                    collimation lens. The pupil of the telescope is then reimaged on a small mirror acting both as the
                    modulator (using piezo actuators to move the PSF in a circular motion around the tip of the pyrmaid
                    optics) and the steering mirror to control off-axis NGSs. The light is then reflected a couple more
                    times, goes through a filter wheel that selects which band will be used, then goes through compact
                    focusing optics, composed of a converging and a diverging lens. Another fold mirror sends the
                    focusing light on a pair of roof prisms, acting as a pyramid optic. This is the same concept
                    validated by the PyWFS of SCExAO. Once split into four beams, a pupil lens (and a last fold mirror)
                    reimages the pupil on the detector of the C-RED ONE camera.</p>

                    <p>A pupil viewing mode is also available (in open-loop), simply by removing the pyramid optics from
                        the beam.</p>

                    <h3>NIRWFS dichroic beamsplitter</h3>

                    <p>The dichroic beamsplitter (DBS) for the NIRWFS is placed at the output of AO188, inside a
                        flip mount attached upside-down. It is placed at a shallow angle of 12 degree to send the light
                        to the NIRWFS. The flip mount allow to move the beamsplitter out of the way without colliding
                        with the IRD injection, but the flip mount can also be removed entirely thanks to locating
                        pins.</p>

                    <p>The core optics were designed to fit the narrow space available inside AO188. Due to the small
                        field-of-view required for the instrument, we can have a small beam size and small optics. This
                        is crucial to have the propoer modulation for the PyWFS. Indeed it is harder to move a 1-inch
                        mirror at kilo-hertz speed than a ½-inch mirror. The compromize is then that the capture
                        field-of-view is not big: we can only use off-axis NGs up to 14" from the target of interest.

                    <ul>
                        <li>A first 2-inch fold mirror.</li>
                        <li>A 150 mm collimation lens. The lens is on a motorized translation stage to change the focus.

                        <li>A ½-inch modulation mirror where the pupil is reimaged. The modulation mirror is on a
                            motorized tip/tilt mount, to use off-axis stars as guide stars.</li>
                        <li>A second 1-inch fold mirror.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A filter wheel that can reduce the bandwidth of the WFS. It contains 3 band filters (y, K or
                            H-band), 2 dual-band filters (y+J and J+H) and an open slot.</li>
                        <li>A third 1-inch fold mirror.</li>
                        <li>A converging+diverging lens combination allows one to focus on the pyramid optics with the
                            right F/ratio while keeping a compact configuration. The diverging lens is on a motorized
                            mount to change the distance between the lenses (therefore the F/ratio), while the
                            combination is on a motorized translation stage to focus precisely on the tip of the pyramid
                            optics.</li>

                            for the PyWFS mode, and one 150 mm lens reimaging the focal plane for the FPWFS mode.</li>

                        against the side of the AO188 bench. This was the only possible solution due to the optical
                        path, the lack of space inside AO188, and the constraint on the shared use of the camera with
                        SCExAO FPDI mode (although this constraint will not exist once the Nasmyth Beam Switcher is
                        installed in Phase II). For alignments, the camera is mounted on a high-load lab jack for
                        vertical alignment, as well as a high-load 2-axis stage, for horizontal and focus alignment.
                        This is a duplication of the alignment mount of the FPDI, which performs very well.</p>
