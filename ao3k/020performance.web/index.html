                        The seeing was above average: 0.7 to 1.1". We observed several targets with similar magnitudes
                        in J and H. Images were recorded with SCExAO's internal SWIR camera Palila (First Light Imaging

                        of the instrument as a whole, including the steering capability (the patrol FoV).
                        In both PyWFS and FPWFS, the required FoV is 2.8x2.8”, defined by the control region of the
                        ALPAO 64x64 DM. It is much smaller for the 188 DM. The FoV of the PyWFS was measured at 5x6”,
                        and the FoV of the FPWFS is 4x5”.
                        The patrol FoV was measured by moving the calibration source and recentering the image using the
                        steering mirror.
                        It is over ±10” vertically, >+7 and <-20” horizontally. The range is good, but it will be

                            <p>For IRCS's echelle spectroscopic mode, a dithering sequence is necessary to move the
                                object of interest along the slit of the spectrograph. We tested that functionnality
                                during the engineering night of May 25, 2023. We found that, due to the current design
                                of the steering/modulating mirror, the stage introduces a drift during the dithering
                                sequence, of about 50 mas per frame (see figure top right below). Since the drift seems
                                to be linear, we will remove this componant and test it in S23B, which should leave a
                                dithering error below 50 mas, without any drift. A redesign of the steering mount is
                                also in progress to improve the absolute positioning and repeatability of the steering
                                and dithering modes.</p>
