  <h2>Science-ready Capabilities:</h2>

<p>
  The SCExAO instrument is continuously growing and is therefore being commissioned in phases. As of February 2017 phases I & II of engineering have been completed. These include the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li><em><b>Extreme adaptive optics:</b></em>The pyramid wavefront sensor is now capable of offering 70-85% Strehl ratio in H-band in median seeing conditions. </li>
  <br>
  <li><em><b>Coronagraphs:</b></em> The SCExAO instrument is equipped with several coronagraphs, which operate across the near-IR (y-K bands). Those that can be used in S17B include the Phase induced amplitude apodization (PIAA), the <a href="../../03team/02collab/"> Vector Vortex</a> and a traditional Lyot coronagraph. Currently the PIAA and vector vortex are only optimized for H-band. New, broadband coronagraphs are being developed and should be available in the not to distant future.</li>
  <br>
  <li><em><b>Low order control:</b></em> The low order wavefront sensor (LOWFS) is used to fine-tune the tip/tilt and other low order modes (focus, astigmatism, etc) at the coronagraphic mask to ensure optimum starlight rejection.</li>
  <br>
  <li><em><b>Coherent differential imaging:</b></em> The speckle nulling routine allows for bright quasi-static speckles due to diffraction from the spiders and the central obstruction, to be reduced. The performance of this mode is limited by the current generation of cameras but it allows for a dark hole to be dug on one side of the PSF and improves companion detectability (See below).</li>
  <br>
  <li><em><b>Astrometry and photometry:</b></em> A grid of artificial speckles can be created with a precisely calibrated amplitude that can be used to calibrate the photometry and astrometry to the companion. The speckles are created by the deformable mirror and can be placed at any location/orientation (within the control region of the DM) in the focal plane. Their brightness can also be controlled. This enables astrometry behind the coronagraph and offers a unique avenue to contrast calibration.</li>

  <br>
  <li><em><b>Integral field spectroscopy:</b></em> CHARIS offers the possibility to obtain low resolution spectra (R~20 or 80) across a 2” field behind SCExAO. All observing modes of CHARIS can be used with all other modes described above. Full details of CHARIS can be found <a href='http://scholar.princeton.edu/charis'><i>here</i></a>.</li>
  <br>	
  <li><em><b>VAMPIRES:</b></em> The VAMPIRES interferometric imager will enable diffraction-limited imaging in the visible with polarimetric capabilities. The performance and observational setting options are listed below.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Cameras</h3>
  <p>
  Speckle nulling is performed with the camera used for high frame rate imaging. This camera is the same as the one used for the LOWFS. They are both Axiom Optics OWL SW1.7HS units, which have an InGaAs CMOS array with 320x256 pixels that are 30x30 &mu;m in size. These cameras can run full frame at 176 Hz and have a read noise of 115 and 140 e<sup>-</sup> respectively. The dark current is such that the maximum exposure is ~1 s. Please note that the speckle nulling routine operates on the speckles which are ~1000 x fainter than the central PSF and hence this must be taken into consideration when selecting your target, in light of the noise characteristics. A speckle nulling map can be pre-carved off sky and then applied on-sky in the case targets are too faint to operate speckle nulling on. However, this is not as accurate as performing the nulling process on the star of interest. The high frame rate/speckle nulling camera can be used with a series of bandpass filters which include: y-band, J-band, H-band and 50 nm bandwidth centered at 1650 nm.

  <h3>Calibration source</h3>
  <p>
  The internal calibration source consists of a Fianium super continuum source and 2 laser diodes centered at 650 and 1550 nm. The light from the source is delivered via an endlessely single-mode fiber to the bench ensuring a diffraction-limited calibration PSF from the visible to K-band. The brightness and spectral bands of the injected light can be easily controlled. In addition there is a turbulence simulator that can be used for realistic simulations of on-sky performance in the laboratory.

  <h3>VAMPIRES</h3>
  <p>
  The Visible Aperture Masking Polarimetric Interferometer for Resolving Exoplanetary Signatures (VAMPIRES) instrument draws on the established success of sparse aperture masking interferometry (also known as non-redundant masking) and combines it with differential polarimetry, to provide diffraction limited scattered-light imaging of circumstellar environments. Primary science targets include protoplanetary disks as well as the mass-loss shells of evolved stars. It is being developed in collaboration with a team from the University of Sydney, Australia, consisting of Peter Tuthill, Barnaby Norris, Guillaume Schworer and Paul Stewart.
  </p>
  <p>
  Sparse aperture masking (SAM) allows the full diffraction limit of the telescope to be recovered by using selected sub-pupils of the telescope pupil as interferometer baselines. See, for example, Tuthill, et al. (2000), PASP, 112, 555; Huelamo, et al., (2011), A&A, 528, L7; Kraus & Ireland, (2012), ApJ, 745, 5. The addition of differential polarimetry allows SAM’s differential observables to be far more precisely calibrated, while providing polarization information of the target.
  </p>
  <p>
  In a technique complementary to infrared coronagraphy, VAMPIRES provides an effective inner-working-angle at 600 to 800 nm of ~10 mas, depending on the contrast ratio. A comprehensive description of the instrument is given in Norris, et al. (2015), MNRAS, 447, 3. The science potential of VAMPIRES’ core technique - differential polarimetric spare aperture masking - is demonstrated in Norris, et al., (2012), Nature, 484, 220.
  </p>
  <p>
  An instrument schematic is given below. Three tiers of differential calibration allow interferometric visibilities to be calibrated to 0.1%, and closure phases to better than a degree. In its primary mode (with masks and the polarimeter), VAMPIRES offers spatial resolution at the diffraction limit (<10 mas), while having a relatively small field-of-view — around ~500 mas — as defined by the shortest baseline. The sensitivity of VAMPIRES observations in the primary mode is determined by the contrast ratio between the unresolved stellar flux and the overall scattered-light flux from the circumstellar dust. As a guide, a star:disk contrast ratio of 1000:1 provides a 1 sigma detection on a single baseline. Depending on the aperture mask employed, typically hundreds or even thousands of baselines (in the case of the annular mask) are measured.
  </p>
  <p>
  In addition to the primary differential-polarized SAM mode, VAMPIRES also offers several additional modes: conventional masking mode (non-polarized) and a polarized imaging mode (full pupil, no masks).
  <p>
  VAMPIRES can operate simultaneously with SCExAO/HiCIAO NIR observations. While wavelengths > 1μm are sent to SCExAO’s IR channel and HiCIAO, shorter wavelengths are sent to the SCExAO visible channel (including the pyramid WFS) and VAMPIRES.
  </p>
  <p>
  The data product produced by VAMPIRES is a set of differential interferometric Visibilities and Closure Phases. The team at the University of Sydney provide expertise in interpretation of these data, including model-fitting. An example data set is shown in the figure below.
