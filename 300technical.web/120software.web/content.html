<h1> Data Analysis Software and Pipelines</h1>

<h2>CHARIS</h2>

<h3>Data Reduction Pipeline (CHARIS-DRP)</h3>
The <a href="http://princetonuniversity.github.io/charis-dep/">CHARIS data reduction pipeline</a> produces calibrated data cubes, and provides some more advanced data reduction capabilities.
See also <a href="https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/charis-dep">source code</a>.

<h3>Automated Data Extraction, Processing, and Tracking System (ADEPTS)</h3>

The automated data extraction, processing, and tracking system (ADEPTS) for CHARIS (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv201210444T/abstract">Tobin et al. 2020</a>, currently under development) will provide end-to-end automatic processing.

<h3>Calibration Files</h3>
ADEPTS curates calibration files created by the DRPâ€™s buildcal routine. They are being hosted on this <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17yjCuE-4i_I_Unbu8MjeZhIgHIFnnqRv">Google Drive</a>, currently containing all calibrations from 2017-03-12 through 2021-01-21 organized by [observing date]/[band]/[designation of the first image]. Observers using the ADEPTS calibration files should include citation to <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv201210444T/abstract">Tobin et al. 2020</a>.
